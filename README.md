# Ansible Role: Windows Initial Setup

This is a reworking of the excellent scripts created by Disassembler <disassembler@dasm.cz>. It automates several tasks done post-install on Windows 10, as well as Server 2016 and Server 2019. All credit to the original author who maintains, develops, and tests all of the actions that this play is based upon.

This is a work in progress - Things will fail.
